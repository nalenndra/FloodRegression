# Modeling the Impact of Flood Disasters and Regional Economic Conditions on Indonesia's GDP Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project explores the impact of flood disasters and regional economic conditions on Indonesia's GDP using machine learning techniques. It aims to develop predictive models to understand how factors like rainfall frequency, number of disasters, and economic indicators affect the GDP across various provinces.

## Objectives
- To analyze the impact of flood disasters and economic conditions on Indonesia's GDP.
- To build machine learning models to predict GDP changes based on disaster data and economic indicators.
- To provide insights that can help policymakers in disaster management and economic planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as:
- **Province**: The province in Indonesia.
- **Year**: The year of the data record.
- **Y (GDP)**: The Gross Domestic Product of the province.
- **Moderate Rainfall Frequency**: The frequency of moderate rainfall events.
- **Heavy Rainfall Frequency**: The frequency of heavy rainfall events.
- **Rainfall in mm**: Total rainfall measured in millimeters.
- **Number of Disasters**: The total number of flood disaster events.
- **Casualties**: Including deaths, missing persons, injuries, suffering, and evacuees.
- **Affected Buildings**: Number of buildings impacted by the disasters.
- **Disaster Index**: A calculated index representing the severity of the disasters.
- **Population**: The population of the province.
- **Open Unemployment Rate**: The rate of open unemployment in the province.
- **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Realization**: The realized foreign investment in the province.
- **Domestic Investment Realization**: The realized domestic investment in the province.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to understand relationships and identifying key features.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Building regression models to predict GDP using flood-related variables and economic indicators.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics and tuning for accuracy.

## Results
- Developed regression models that predict GDP changes based on flood and economic data.
- Insights on the relationship between flood severity, economic conditions, and regional GDP variations.
- Informing policy decisions on disaster preparedness and economic resilience.
